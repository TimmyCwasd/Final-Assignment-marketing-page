  <h1>Do you hate the hot, humid summer weather? Well, do we have the invention for you!</h1>
  <p>The breasy is an automatic cooling system that pulls the moisture from your home outside and fresh cool air inside. The breasy turns on automatically when it detects the home is hotter than 21 degrees celsius.</p>
