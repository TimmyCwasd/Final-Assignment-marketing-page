    <p class="text">There are methods that could reduce the effects of computer production that both the producers and consumers can do. 
    <p class="text">First of all, limit the amount of devices and/or electronics you need. This could be in the form of only using one monitor for your desktop or using just a laptop instead of a personal computer and one.</p>
    <p class="text">As well, try your best to use your devices fully before switching, replacing is both expensive and harmful to the environment.</p>
    <p class="text">Now, for the producers. It would be best to begin using more sustainable resources to make computer parts, natural resources would break down easier and reduce the energy needed to acquire them.</p>

    <p class="text">When it comes to using a computer, there are also ways to reduce the energy consumption.</p>
    <p class="text">The first thing you should focus on is your power supply. When you are not using it, consider keeping it on power saving mode, shutting it off, or unplugging it from the outlet completely. 
      An article from the Univeristy of Oxford found that 80% of energy is saved when the computer is unplugged compared to turned on.</p>
    <p class="text">As previously mentioned, storing data uses electricity. It is because of that why you should remove any unnecessary files.</p>

          <p class="text">There exists electronic recycling programs in many countries that allow you to throw out unused devices to have their parts repurposed. This serves as a great alternative to throwing out your electronics and </p>
          <p class="text">Although eco-friendly options for computer disposal exists, you should still take into account adaptability when purchasing a device. 
            For example, look for choosing a newer generation motherboard for a desktop so that you will not have to replace it along with your cpu and ram when looking to upgrade.</p>
